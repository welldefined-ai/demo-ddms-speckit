# Specification Quality Checklist: DDMS Web Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement
- All descriptions are business/user-focused
- No mention of Python, databases, or technical architecture
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements derived from detailed requirements.md
- All 72 functional requirements are specific and testable
- 20 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- All 6 user stories have clear acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases section covers 8 critical scenarios
- Scope clearly defined through user stories and requirements
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions

### Feature Readiness: ✅ PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P6) and independently testable
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "within 3 seconds", "95% of devices", "under 5 minutes")
- No technical implementation details in specification

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent - comprehensive coverage based on detailed requirements.md

**Strengths**:
- 6 user stories properly prioritized with clear MVP path (P1: Real-time monitoring)
- Each user story is independently testable and deliverable
- 72 functional requirements with clear FR-XXX identifiers
- 20 measurable success criteria without technical implementation details
- Edge cases comprehensively covered
- Key entities well-defined
- Assumptions documented

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ YES - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
