# Feature Specification: Complete DDMS System Polish and Production Readiness

**Feature Branch**: `002-finish-remaining-tasks`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "finish remaining tasks"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - System Configuration Management (Priority: P1)

The system owner configures global system settings including data retention policies, backup schedules, monitoring parameters, and language preferences through a dedicated settings interface. These configurations apply across all devices and users, ensuring consistent system behavior.

**Why this priority**: System configuration is essential for production deployment and operational management. Without it, administrators cannot customize system behavior to match organizational needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by owner logging in, accessing settings page, modifying retention period and backup schedule, saving changes, and verifying new settings persist across server restarts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** owner is logged in, **When** they navigate to system settings, **Then** current configuration displays with all editable fields
2. **Given** owner is viewing settings, **When** they update data retention period, **Then** system validates input and saves new value
3. **Given** owner is viewing settings, **When** they configure backup schedule, **Then** automated backups run at specified times
4. **Given** system settings are modified, **When** server restarts, **Then** all configuration values persist correctly
5. **Given** owner needs system status, **When** they access health endpoint, **Then** database status, service status, and version information display

---

### User Story 2 - Automated Database Management (Priority: P2)

The system automatically manages TimescaleDB operations including data retention enforcement, compression of historical data, and scheduled backups without manual intervention. Operators receive notifications before automatic data cleanup occurs.

**Why this priority**: Automated database management prevents storage overflow and maintains system performance over time. This is critical for long-term operational stability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring a device with short retention period, accumulating data beyond retention window, and verifying automatic cleanup occurs per schedule without data loss within retention window.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** device has 90-day retention policy, **When** data older than 90 days exists, **Then** system automatically deletes oldest data daily
2. **Given** historical data exists, **When** data is older than 7 days, **Then** TimescaleDB compresses chunks to reduce storage
3. **Given** retention cleanup is scheduled, **When** cleanup will occur within 24 hours, **Then** admin users receive in-app warning banner
4. **Given** automated backup is configured, **When** scheduled time arrives, **Then** database backup executes and saves to configured location
5. **Given** backup completes, **When** checking backup files, **Then** timestamped backup file exists with complete database dump

---

### User Story 3 - Device Reconnection and Failure Notifications (Priority: P1)

When Modbus device connections fail, the system automatically retries connection every 60 seconds indefinitely. After 3 consecutive connection failures, admin and owner users receive in-app notification banners visible when logged in, enabling prompt troubleshooting.

**Why this priority**: Reliable device connectivity with automatic recovery is essential for unattended industrial monitoring. Notification of persistent failures enables timely intervention.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by disconnecting a Modbus device, verifying retry attempts occur every 60 seconds, confirming notification banner appears after 3 failures for admin users, and verifying notification clears when device reconnects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** connected device loses connection, **When** connection fails, **Then** system marks device offline and retries connection after 60 seconds
2. **Given** device remains offline, **When** 3 consecutive connection attempts fail, **Then** admin and owner users see notification banner when logged in
3. **Given** notification banner is displayed, **When** device reconnects successfully, **Then** notification banner automatically clears
4. **Given** device is offline, **When** checking device list, **Then** last successful reading timestamp and offline duration display
5. **Given** multiple devices are offline, **When** viewing notifications, **Then** notification lists all offline devices with failure counts

---

### User Story 4 - Production Deployment Infrastructure (Priority: P2)

System operators deploy DDMS on on-premises servers using provided Docker Compose configuration, deployment scripts, and Nginx reverse proxy with TLS. Deployment process is documented and automated for consistent installations.

**Why this priority**: Production-ready deployment infrastructure is required for customer installations. Without it, deployment requires manual configuration and lacks security hardening.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running deployment script on clean server, verifying all containers start correctly, confirming HTTPS access works, and validating health endpoint responds through reverse proxy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** clean server with Docker installed, **When** operator runs deployment script, **Then** all services start and health checks pass
2. **Given** deployment is complete, **When** accessing system via browser, **Then** HTTPS connection works with valid TLS configuration
3. **Given** system is deployed, **When** checking Nginx logs, **Then** reverse proxy correctly forwards requests to backend and frontend
4. **Given** operator needs to update system, **When** running deployment script with new version, **Then** zero-downtime update completes successfully
5. **Given** deployment script runs, **When** checking configuration, **Then** environment variables load correctly from .env files

---

### User Story 5 - Monitoring and Observability (Priority: P3)

System administrators monitor DDMS health using Prometheus metrics endpoint exposing device reading counts, API request latencies, error rates, and database query performance. Metrics enable proactive identification of performance issues.

**Why this priority**: Observability is valuable for production operations but system functions without external monitoring. Can be added after core functionality is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing /metrics endpoint, verifying Prometheus-format metrics are exposed, and confirming metrics update in real-time as system operates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** system is running, **When** accessing /metrics endpoint without authentication, **Then** Prometheus-format metrics display
2. **Given** device readings are collected, **When** checking metrics, **Then** device_readings_total counter increments per device
3. **Given** API requests are made, **When** checking metrics, **Then** api_request_duration_seconds histogram shows latency distribution
4. **Given** database queries execute, **When** checking metrics, **Then** database query performance metrics are exposed
5. **Given** errors occur, **When** checking metrics, **Then** error counts by type and endpoint are tracked

---

### User Story 6 - Enhanced User Experience and Error Handling (Priority: P4)

Users experience polished interface with loading indicators during asynchronous operations, graceful error messages when issues occur, empty state guidance for new installations, and responsive design working on tablets with touch controls.

**Why this priority**: UX polish improves usability and professionalism but system delivers core value without these enhancements. Can be refined based on user feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing system on tablet, attempting operations that trigger loading states and errors, and verifying empty states display for new installations without devices configured.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** page is loading data, **When** user waits, **Then** skeleton screen or spinner displays during fetch
2. **Given** no devices are configured, **When** user views dashboard, **Then** empty state displays with guidance to add first device
3. **Given** API request fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** user-friendly error message displays with suggested actions
4. **Given** React component error occurs, **When** error boundary catches it, **Then** fallback UI displays instead of blank page
5. **Given** user accesses on tablet, **When** interacting with charts, **Then** touch-friendly controls work without mouse/keyboard
6. **Given** user accesses on older browser, **When** page loads, **Then** compatibility warning displays with supported browser list

---

### User Story 7 - Documentation and Development Workflow (Priority: P5)

Developers and operators access comprehensive documentation including API reference, architecture decisions, deployment guides, and troubleshooting procedures. CI pipeline automatically validates code quality and test coverage on every commit.

**Why this priority**: Documentation and CI improve maintainability and reduce onboarding time but system is fully functional without them. Valuable for long-term project sustainability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by new developer reading documentation, successfully deploying system following guides, and verifying CI pipeline runs tests and blocks merges when coverage drops below 80%.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new developer joins project, **When** reading README, **Then** they can set up development environment in under 30 minutes
2. **Given** operator needs to deploy, **When** following quickstart guide, **Then** production deployment completes without external assistance
3. **Given** developer needs API details, **When** accessing API documentation, **Then** OpenAPI spec with examples is available
4. **Given** code is committed, **When** CI pipeline runs, **Then** tests execute and coverage is validated >= 80%
5. **Given** architecture decision needed, **When** reviewing ADRs, **Then** rationale for key technology choices is documented

### Edge Cases

- **Storage capacity approaching limit**: What happens when disk space is nearly full? System displays critical warning banner to admin users 7 days before automatic cleanup, allows manual export of at-risk data, and continues operating within retention window.

- **Concurrent configuration changes**: What happens when multiple admins modify system configuration simultaneously? Last write wins with transaction safety; audit log records all changes with username and timestamp; conflicts are rare due to small team size.

- **Database backup failure**: What happens when scheduled backup fails? System logs error with detailed reason, retries backup after 1 hour, displays notification banner to owner after 3 consecutive backup failures, continues monitoring operations unaffected.

- **TimescaleDB compression in progress**: What happens when user queries data being compressed? Queries continue working transparently; TimescaleDB handles reads during compression; no user-visible impact beyond slightly slower query time for affected chunks.

- **Metrics endpoint under high load**: How does system handle many Prometheus scrapes? Metrics endpoint is read-only with minimal overhead; response cached for 10 seconds; no authentication required allows monitoring without credentials; rate limiting prevents abuse.

- **Nginx reverse proxy failure**: What happens when Nginx crashes? System monitoring detects failure and restarts Nginx automatically via Docker health check; brief interruption (2-3 seconds) as reverse proxy restarts; active SSE connections reconnect automatically.

- **Migration script error during deployment**: What happens when Alembic migration fails? Deployment script halts and rolls back database to previous version; error message with troubleshooting steps displays; no partial migrations applied; operator can fix issue and retry.

- **Empty system after fresh installation**: How is brand-new system presented? Empty states guide owner to create first device; default owner credentials provided in documentation; system health check passes even with zero devices; sample device configuration available in docs.

### Key Entities

- **SystemConfiguration**: Represents global system settings with retention period (default 90 days), backup schedule (cron expression), language preference (EN/CN), session timeout, and last modified timestamp. Singleton pattern ensures only one configuration exists.

- **BackupJob**: Represents scheduled or manual database backup with start timestamp, completion timestamp, backup file path, status (running/success/failed), file size, and error message if failed. Enables backup history tracking.

- **ConnectionFailureNotification**: Represents device connection failure alert with device reference, failure count, first failure timestamp, last failure timestamp, acknowledged flag, and cleared timestamp. Enables notification persistence and acknowledgment.

- **PrometheusMetrics**: Represents exported metrics including counters (device_readings_total, api_errors_total), histograms (api_request_duration_seconds, database_query_duration_seconds), and gauges (active_sse_connections, connected_devices_count). Updated in real-time as system operates.

- **DeploymentConfiguration**: Represents Docker and Nginx configuration with container settings, environment variables, TLS certificate paths, port mappings, and health check parameters. Enables repeatable deployments.

### Assumptions

- **Docker Environment**: System assumes Docker and Docker Compose are installed on target server; deployment scripts validate presence before proceeding.

- **TLS Certificates**: Assumes operator provides valid TLS certificates for HTTPS; self-signed certificates acceptable for internal deployments; certificate paths configured via environment variables.

- **Backup Storage**: Assumes sufficient disk space for backups in configured directory; typical backup size is 10-20% of active database size; retention policy keeps 30 most recent backups.

- **Server Resources**: Assumes server has minimum 4GB RAM and 50GB storage for production deployment with 100 devices; larger deployments may require scaling.

- **Network Access**: Assumes server can access internal network for Modbus devices but does NOT require external internet connectivity; entirely on-premises operation supported.

- **Prometheus Deployment**: Assumes external Prometheus server will scrape /metrics endpoint; metrics are exposed but DDMS does not include Prometheus installation.

- **CI Environment**: Assumes GitHub Actions or similar CI platform; pipeline configuration adaptable to GitLab CI, Jenkins, or other platforms.

- **Browser Standards**: Assumes users run modern browsers supporting ES2020, WebSocket/EventSource, and CSS Grid; older browsers show compatibility warning.

- **Time Synchronization**: Assumes server uses NTP for accurate timekeeping; backup schedules and retention policies depend on correct system time.

- **Operator Expertise**: Assumes basic Linux system administration skills for deployment; comprehensive documentation provided for standard deployment scenarios.
