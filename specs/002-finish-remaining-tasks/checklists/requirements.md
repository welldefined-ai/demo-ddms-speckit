# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete DDMS System Polish and Production Readiness

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Assessment
- **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS - Spec describes WHAT (system configuration, automated backups, metrics endpoint) without HOW (specific libraries, frameworks, or code structure)
- **User value focused**: ✅ PASS - All user stories explain business value and operational benefits
- **Non-technical language**: ✅ PASS - Written for system owners and operators; technical terms (Docker, Prometheus, TimescaleDB) are explained in context
- **Mandatory sections**: ✅ PASS - All required sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- **No clarification markers**: ✅ PASS - Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in specification
- **Testable requirements**: ✅ PASS - All 60 functional requirements are verifiable (e.g., "System MUST retry connection every 60 seconds" can be measured)
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✅ PASS - All 24 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentage, counts)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: ✅ PASS - Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (e.g., "deployment completes in under 15 minutes" vs "Docker container starts")
- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✅ PASS - Each user story has 4-6 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path and edge cases
- **Edge cases**: ✅ PASS - 8 edge cases identified covering storage limits, concurrent changes, backup failures, etc.
- **Scope boundaries**: ✅ PASS - Clear boundaries defined (completes Phase 8 polish tasks from tasks.md, builds on completed US1-US5)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ PASS - Assumptions section documents Docker, TLS certs, backup storage, server resources, etc.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- **Requirements with acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS - All 60 FRs map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- **User scenarios coverage**: ✅ PASS - 7 user stories cover all aspects of polish phase (config, database, reconnection, deployment, monitoring, UX, docs)
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✅ PASS - Success criteria directly testable against user stories (SC-001 to SC-024)
- **No implementation leakage**: ✅ PASS - Spec focuses on capabilities, not code/architecture (appropriate mentions of Docker/Prometheus are deployment/integration standards, not implementation details)

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT
- All checklist items pass validation
- No clarifications needed - spec is complete and ready for planning phase
- Requirements are testable, unambiguous, and technology-agnostic at appropriate level
- Success criteria provide clear measurable targets for implementation validation
- Edge cases comprehensively cover failure scenarios and boundary conditions

**Readiness for Next Phase**: ✅ APPROVED
- Specification meets all quality gates
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
- No spec updates required
